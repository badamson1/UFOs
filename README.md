# UFOs
## Overview
For this project we wanted to build a website that we can import data into to have searchable filters regarding UFO sightings

The main bulk of the page provides a detailed summary on the background of the website.

To find information on specific UFO sightings, you can use the filters on the lower left hand side of the main page. You can filter on dates, cities, states, countries:

## Summary
One drawback of this site is that it looks very clunky. Two recommendations for further development:
1. Providing the filter table in a separate tab on the website
2. Splitting the background paragraphs into buttons
